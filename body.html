      Hey. My name's Ritvik, and I like to code. I enjoy coding front-end and backend, and I love to try new things. I'm still very inexperienced and still learning though. Aside from web development, I am proficient in java, python, and react native. I'm currently in high school and coding for me has been a past time hobby.

      Well, as the arcade game suggests, I like to play video games, and, as mentioned before, I like to code. When you put thesee two together, you get coding games. I have tried this in Unity, but can't say that I'm too good at it. Aside from coding and playing video games, I play the violin.

      Most of my works have been submitted to hackathons. Some include, Manage.Co, a mobile app for managing your company, and MentorThis, a website for students to get feedback on their projects. Check out my github (f8-rp) for more.
